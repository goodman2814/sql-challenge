# Employee Database
This project is part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of SQL, data engenering, and data analysis. We are required to work through the data to discover any discrepancies. 

### Methods Used
* ERD Tables
* Data Analysis
* Data Engineering

### Technologies 
* Python
* PostGres, MySql
* Pandas, jupyter


## Project Description
Our first task is a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, we will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 

Create an ERD to sketch out the tables:
